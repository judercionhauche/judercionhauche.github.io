						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> In this article I learned about the ethical concerns surrounding the use of dark patterns in UX design.
							 The author argues that designers have a responsibility to ensure that their designs are ethical and transparent, and that they should not use dark patterns to deceive users.
							  I also learned about examples of dark patterns such as "sneak into basket" (adding unwanted items to a user's shopping cart. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I found the part that actually listens different types of dark patterns and I further researched to learn about these dark patterns. For example i learned that ,"confirm shaming" is guilting users into taking an action they may not want to take, and "roach motel" is making it difficult for users to cancel or unsubscribe from a service.  </p>
