            <li>1. I learned that when designing an app you have to know first what the app aims to solve</li>
            <li>It is key to know the key users and how they are going to interact with the app</li>
            <li>Spotify's components are structured such that users can easily understand  the content</li> 
         </ul>
          
         <p> 2. My favorite part of this article was when the writer spoke about how important it is to focus on the landing page as an app user or as someone who 
            is thrilled about product design. Also, the favorite part is when the write spoke about how important it is to focus on different
            app products so you can see the trend in them and develop your own unique app.
