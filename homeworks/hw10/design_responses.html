							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> The article provides valuable insights into the relationship between human attention and UX design, and how designers can use this knowledge to create more effective and engaging interfaces.  I found the part about the divided attention interesting. His suggestion that UX designers can use this concept to design interfaces that prioritize the most important information and draw users' attention to specific elements is a great way for the user to know the most important features once they hop into the website. If the attention on certain features is evenly divided then users might miss the most important or the current important feature on the website, it can be a promo or anything else that would give the user a great benefit. Therefore, understanding human attention in creating effective and engaging user experiences is critical because peopleâ€™s attention is indeed a limited resource. </p>

							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> 9/10. Understanding the principles of human attention is critical for web designers because it helps them create more effective and engaging user experiences. Web designers must design interfaces that are visually appealing, easy to use, and engaging for users. By understanding how the human brain processes information and attention, web designers can create interfaces that are more intuitive, easy to use, and keep users engaged. Therefore this article was compelling to read. One key take away is that for example, knowing that people have limited attention spans, web designers can prioritize information and use visual cues to guide users' attention to the most important elements on the page. They can also use design principles like contrast, color, and typography to create visual hierarchy and draw attention to specific elements. By creating interfaces that are easy to navigate and understand, web designers can help users accomplish their goals more quickly and efficiently.</p>
